# Abstract Factory Pattern

- - - - - 

Suppose that you have a software company and your team needs to create a software
which reads several different file types and create parses for that types.
File types are XML, CSV and Text file. Your task is create and design a java program
and the program can be able to read and parse different formatted data and
save the record. Design your program with respect Factory Method Design Pattern
and do not violate Open Closed Principle.You don't need to implement all the codes
such as read xml or csv files. Just make necessary implementations and report
as a console message.
